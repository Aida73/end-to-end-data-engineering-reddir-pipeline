Require some expert advice here from a newbie. Not solving for world hunger but looking for the best way to solve this problem and wondering how the rest of the data engineering world would go about solutioning this.

Details are:

1.       My source systems are API files and the ingested format is stored in ADLS GEN2 as parquet files.

2.       I use Databricks and the medallion architecture and delta tables for data engineering activities.

3.       My target application is SAP Datasphere. Its SAP’s cloud solution to data warehouse. If you are wondering why not perform the data engineering activity in SAP Datasphere, we can but for the sake of this conversation, lets leave that for another day.

So the problem that I am trying to understand here is this, given that delta table in Databricks is made out of multiple parquet files and another folder call \_delta\_log, in my Gold layer, I am seeing multiple parquet file and this additional \_delta\_log folder. I know this is not an issue if I am querying the folder as opposed to the individual parquet file.

So the question here is this, when I expose my ADLS GEN2 for the GOLD layer to SAP Datasphere, SAP Datasphere will have access to all of the parquet files and \_delta\_log folder. I don’t believe this is an issue but I am concern that an uninformed user will read the individual parquet file instead of the entire folder and produce incorrect result.

I am wondering if it is best to store my business level aggregate data in the gold layer in a database before as opposed to exposing my ADLS GEN2 to avoid this problem.

I have also attached a screenshot from SAP Datasphere and as you can see, it contains multiple parquet file.

I've been working on and stuck on a data modeling problem for a while.

Incoming data is typical product-attribute data. Products have common attributes, but every product type has specific attributes, like PCs' RAM capacity and CPU core count, TVs' panel technology, resolution, etc. Some attributes have more than 1 value.

I need to design a data model for our data lakehouse, which operates with Delta Lake. 

Here are the proposal models that I am considering:

1)

ProductTable -> Every product sits here with its common attributes.

PcProductTable, TVProductTable, …. -> Create separate tables for each product type and keep specific attributes as separate columns

Multi-valued attributes can be divided into a lookup table or kept in an array inside the corresponding table.

2)

ProductTable -> Every product sits here with its common attributes.

AttributeTable -> EAV table for keeping all attributes in a single table with a value column.

Multi-valued attributes are just inserted as a new row in the table.

Example data:	

product_id , attribute_name , value

1,ram_capacity,8GB

1,country,USA

1,country,Canada

2,resouliton,1920x1080

2,energy consumption,70w


My main concerns are applying delta changes and keeping track of historical data. Applying SDC to the second approach sounds complex, but I don't have any clue how to prove it.

Can you evaluate the proposed models in terms of dimensional modelling and reporting performance?  
Have you guys ever designed a warehouse/lakehouse like this?

Unfortunately, there are instances where additional columns are added to the source data, causing our external SQL databases to break.

Our current workaround involves manually dropping and recreating the external table, which does the job, and Synapse successfully detects the datatypes. However, we aim to automate this process.

One workaround I've considered is running a notebook after the pipeline, which drops and recreates the table to ensure the schema is up to date. Additionally, we might be able to compare the number of columns between the silver layer and the external SQL database later on to see if we can run this when it needs to. 

The only challenge is ensuring that Synapse autodetects column types like it does when done manually. I'm not entirely sure how to achieve this.

Let's say I'd like to run a pipeline that will send exactly 10,000 email alerts (or as many as it can before running out of data), with the addresses to attempt stored in a BigQuery table. Sensibly, you would do this by just querying for 10,000 rows so your input PCollection had the correct number, and push them all through the pipeline.

The hangup is that in this situation, I can't tell whether an email can count as successful until after it's attempted to process. If processing didn't happen (because the email was on a blocklist, etc) I'd like to keep going until the maximum of 10,000 has been fulfilled.

To do this I think I need to do a couple of things:

* Keep track of the number of successful processes across all the workers running the job. If we've reached the limit, process no more rows.
* Pull more rows as needed until the limit is fulfilled (does some sort of streaming arrangement exist in Beam for BigQuery so that a query can pull more rows until the limit has been fulfilled?)

Is Beam a suitable solution for this kind of arrangement, or am I thinking about it wrongly? Thanks for any advice!",1,3,1ccf7nm,2,False,0

I'm having a heck of a time.  If somebody has either mastered the UI Builder or worked with the CDK enough to be pretty comfortable with developing in it, hit me up and I'll pay you for a couple hours of assistance/mentoring.

Not looking for somebody to do it for me, but rather just do a couple pairing sessions and see if I can get unstuck on a couple things.  And I don't expect somebody to do it for free. ",0,1,1cca25z,4,False,0

I only came across answers where you have one repo, but that's not what I want. I want to be flexible in my workflow where I can have different projects running in on airflow instance. 

Do you know of any good tips or trick, lmk!",0,1,1cc89t4,1,False,0

I'm in the process of setting up a table in my AWS RDS, which serves as a crucial data source for my BI tool. As part of the ETL process, I'm consolidating data from multiple tables into a single materialized view, then transforming it into a table (prod\_table\_temp), dropping the existing prod\_table, and finally renaming prod\_table\_temp to prod\_table.

However, I'm aware this approach has its drawbacks. Is there a more efficient way to handle this process, considering our current data store is AWS RDS?

Looking forward to your insights",1,1,1cc5mfc,0,False,0
